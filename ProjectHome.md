A Program zu download Pictures from Transcend Wifi-SD Card to your Desktop.

The Wifi-SD provide a website where u could browse your SD-Card, show all Pictures in a folder, see Thumbnails, Metadata and where u could download the Picture/Movie/File.

The Program ping the SD-Card. If online it load the Fileliste from a specify folder and compare it with 1 or 2 folder. If it not exist it download it.

It Compare it with 2 folder because Lightroom import from a folder into an other in your libery. so itÂ´s nessary to compare with till two folder.

In this Project i use wget to download the files from the SD Card because the Webserver use LF instad of CRLF for Headerlines and this dislike .net or other libarys.


I sold the card after i wrote this Project, because the card is too instable. But i want to share the project for further Development!
